## Modeling

1. KBO_OBP.r 
> + Use KBO league HTS data to determine barrel range
> + Build a regression model predicting On Base Percentage from First Strike Percentage, Whiff Percentage, and Barrel Percentage

2. OBP2019.r
> + Use 2019 MLB Batting data
> + Build a regression model predicting On Base Percetnage from First Strike Percentage, Whiff Percentage, and Barrel Percentage

3. OBP_1.r
> + Use 2015 ~ 2019 MLB Batting data
> + Build a regression model predicting On Base Percetnage from First Strike Percentage, Whiff Percentage, and Barrel Percentage

4. OBP_2.r
> + Use 2015 ~ 2019 MLB Batting data
> + Build a regression model predicting On Base Percetnage from First Strike Percentage, Whiff Percentage, and Hardhit Percentage**(Not barrel%)**

5. OBP_sprint.r
> + Use 2015 ~ 2019 MLB Batting data and players sprint speed data
> + Build a regression model predicting On Base Percetnage from First Strike Percentage, Whiff Percentage, Sprint Speed, and Barrel Percentage
